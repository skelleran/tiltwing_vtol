# tiltwing_vtol
A VTOL with independently tilting wings connected to rotors, and the only other control surface is a tail elevator.


tiltwing_dRehmFlight contains the flight controller source code. It is based on Nicholas Rehm's dRehmFlightVTOL code linked here:

solidworks_parts contains the solidworks parts and assemblies I used to design the drone. The easiest way to navigate is to open drone2.SLDASM and open parts from the assembly. I modelled most parts in this folder, with these exceptions:

Everything in Fasteners folder: McMaster-Carr website https://www.mcmaster.com/

ES08A servo: https://grabcad.com/library/emax-es08a-servo

M2x3mm insert: https://grabcad.com/library/insert-m2x3mm-1

Matek PDB: https://grabcad.com/library/matek-xt60-pdb-1

Teensy 4.0 Board: https://grabcad.com/library/teensy-4-0-1


printable_stl_parts contains the printable parts in stl form. Everything in this folder was completely designed and modeled by me in solidworks, then saved as an stl.
